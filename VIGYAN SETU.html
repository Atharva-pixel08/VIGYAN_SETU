   <h2>Our Story</h2>
 <p>Science is an adventure of the whole human race to learn to live in and perhaps to love the universe in which they are. To be a part of it is to understand oneself, to begin to feel that there is a capacity within man far beyond what he felt he had, of an infinite extension of human possibilities.</p>

<p><center> "I propose that science be taught with a certain historical understanding, with a certain philosophical understanding, with a social understanding, and a human understanding in the sense of the biography, the nature of the people who made this construction, the triumphs, the trials, the tribulations".
<p>--I. I. Rabi, Nobel Laureate</center></p>
<p>This very idea made us realize that it is the right time to look beyond horizons. This led to the birth of an effort – Vigyan Setu Foundation, with an underlying objective of Bridging Science and Society.</p>
